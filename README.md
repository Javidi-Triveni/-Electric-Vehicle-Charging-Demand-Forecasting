# 🚗 **Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Forecasting**

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on forecasting electric vehicle (EV) charging demand using data-driven machine learning methods. The analysis helps identify peak demand hours and station utilization patterns to support smart energy and infrastructure planning.
The entire workflow — from data preprocessing to forecasting and visualization — is implemented in a single Jupyter Notebook: `ev_station_analysis.ipynb`, ensuring simplicity, reproducibility, and clarity.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict hourly EV charging demand at the station and city level.
* Analyze temporal (hour/day) and weather-based demand patterns.
* Generate actionable insights for optimizing charging station distribution.
* Visualize results interactively using Tableau and Python plots.

## 🧠 Key Features

 Complete analysis implemented in Jupyter Notebook (`ev_station_analysis.ipynb`)
✅ Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and weather data integration
✅ XGBoost-based regression forecasting for hourly and city-level demand
✅ Evaluation using MAE and RMSE metrics
✅ Visualization of station and time-level patterns (hour × weekday)
✅ Optional Streamlit dashboard for browser-based interaction

## 🧩 Modeling Workflow

1 Data Preparation

* Aggregated EV charging session data into hourly demand per station.
* Merged weather data (temperature, humidity, etc.) using timestamps.
* Created new features like hour of day, day of week, and encoded station IDs.

2 Station-Level Analysis (Jupyter Notebook: `ev_station_analysis.ipynb`)

The full project workflow — including preprocessing, model training, and visualization — is implemented in this notebook.
It:

* Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on station-level usage.
* Trains an **XGBoost regression model** for forecasting hourly demand.
* Evaluates performance using **MAE** and **RMSE**.
* Produces final forecasts and visual insights for each station.

> *(Note: The Python script `ev_forecast_train.py` provides a command-line version of the training process. Running it is optional and not required for reproducing results.)*

3 Evaluation Metrics
| Model   | MAE   | RMSE  |
| XGBoost | 2.513 | 4.668 |

## 📊 Visualization

The results were visualized using Tableau and Python-based charts:

* Demand Heatmap: Hour vs. Weekday — to highlight daily patterns.
* City-Level Forecast: Displays overall predicted demand trends.
* Station-Level Plots: Show localized demand fluctuations for individual stations.

## 📈 Results & Insights

* Peak charging demand occurs between 18:00–21:00 hours.
* Weekdays show consistently higher utilization compared to weekends.
* The XGBoost model achieved strong performance (MAE: 2.513, RMSE: 4.668).
* Station-level analysis revealed key hotspots for future charger placement.
